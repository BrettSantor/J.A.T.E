Just Another Text Editor, or J.A.T.E, is a text editor in the style of JavaScript and uses IndexDB to save text to the client side database and local storage. This allows you to still access your data when you install this PWA.

## Usage 
Click on the link above to open the site and the header should appear. ![J.A.T.E Header](./assets/images/JATEHeader.png)
Then you can clear the header and start typing away. When the text editor becomes out of focus it saves the text to the client side database. ![IndexDB](/assets/images/indexdb.png)
